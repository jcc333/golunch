I’m going to go Sicko Mode on listening to Sicko Mode
drip - when your outfit or demeanor is above satisfactory. a flex true to ones own self. can be used as a verb, dripping. ie. "my new shirt has me dripping." or "damn, @zable came through with the drip."
this week's word is stan - derived from the 1999 Eminem song, "Stan," which features Dido. as a noun, a stan is a dedicated, sometimes obsessed fan. as a verb (its more recent evolution), it is more light hearted than the noun, expressing loyalty or support towards someone, something. ie. "we stan jet's pizza" or "@brooke stans chips."
due to the shortened week (i'm OOO Monday and Friday), there will be no Mylo's Weekly Word. instead, there will be homework. please use drip and/or stan in conversation with your friends and family this July 4th weekend.
tweakin - Chicago specific slang. describes someone who is wrong, overly rowdy, or foolish. can also describe someone who cannot handle their drugs or alcohol. ex: "@jimch, thinks the Dave Matthews Band is better than The Beach Boys? he's tweakin."
 peristeronic - adjective, of or relating to pigeons. Greek peristera dove, pigeon + English -onic. ex: “But I do like the look of a dovecote. After all, these peristeronic palaces do grace the gardens of some of our finest stately homes.” Alan Titchmarsh; Tales from Titchmarsh; Hodder & Stoughton; 2011.
 lick - noun. while commonly used in music to describe acquiring money quickly and illegally, the Chicago definition of lick is used to describe an object you acquired easily or cheaply. "@Justin Fong hit a lick at the thrift store. Came away with like five shirts for three dollars."
easy dub - noun. popularized by online video gaming, an easy dub is a victory earned without breaking a sweat. fortnite-adjacent. "@John Petersen was playing CS and got that easy dub
plug - noun. a person who has access to facilities, services, or items that the average person may not. an evolution of the word "connect" or "connection," a metaphor for the prongs that connect the device that needs power to the outlet. ex: "@zable has the amish plug for lumber and firewood."
icy - while generally used as "ice" in the early 2000's to refer to diamond jewelry, icy can refer to any specific part of your look that is a particular flex or "cool, cold." if you have plural items that are icy, this would result in drip (#mylosweeklyword: June 20th, 2019). a person displaying plural icy items could potentially be so hot, that said items would be melting, thus resulting in drip. ex: "@colette likes to rock the icy rose gold Apple Watch."
“they call my jeezy the snowman, im iced out and i got that snow man”
:fire:
sauce - sauce is having attitude or confidence, pioneered by the poet Radric Delantic Davis (Gucci Mane) with this proverb: “If a man does not have sauce, then he is lost. But the same man can get lost in the sauce.” ex: "My friend came to the party with no drip, but he was life of the party. He had the sauce."
sicko mode - coined through the song 'Sicko Mode' by Houston-rapper Travis Scott, to go sicko mode is to elevate your current activity to a higher tier (similar to the early 2000's slang, beast mode). the song 'Sicko Mode' featured Canadian pop-singer Drake, who created the word sicko based on Toronto's area code 416, formerly spelled as 6icko. ex: "@andrew.peebles said he wasn't hungry but went sicko mode and ate 50 pizzas."
